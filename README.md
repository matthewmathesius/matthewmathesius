## Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

### Who Am I?
My name is Matthew Mathesius and I'm a recent graduate with a **Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering** and currently enrolled in the **4+1 Bachelor's to Master's Thesis** track at Florida Polytechnic University. My focus is in *material characterization and fatigue behavior* and am looking to take these skills into R&D roles for aerospace manufacturing applications. I've utilized SolidWorks and MATLAB regularly in previous academic endeavors in addition to using other 3D modeling softwares for design work at a previous internship with Cleveland Cliffs, the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America. When I'm not focusing on designing and innovating, I find myself:
1. Indulging in new and old music all across different genres ðŸŽµ
2. Exploring new places, ideally in the mountains of Kentucky (my hometown you see above!) and Tennessee â›°
3. Playing with and tinkering 3D printers to make all sorts of custom things ðŸ”§

> Overall, I describe myself as a problem-solver with high resiliency and critical thinking skills tailored to solving the everyday problems in industry. Am looking forward to the future work that lies ahead!
